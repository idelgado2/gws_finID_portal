# GWS FinID Portal
### Jerry Moxley, 2018-19

This repository includes the software development of a shiny-based data entry portal for cataloguing FinID photos for MBA white shark research.  The goal is to standardize the collection and stewardship of fin photos and associated metadata collected on shark surveys in central California.  In order to submit new sightings, a data record MUST contain a fin photo as well as survey location, date, sighting number, and (optionally) sex and size.  At the core of the standardization is distinguishing photoIDs from reference IDs.  A photoID (*phid* in code) is a fin observation collected from a photo or video that records an isolated, individual shark sighting.  The reference ID (*refID* in the code) is a curated list that encapsulates only the best photo of each individually-recognized shark and used in matching photoIDs to an individual's longitudinal record.

## Features & structure
App development focused on a three panel workflow to streamline entry of survey data, sighting observations, and database submission.  At its core, the app is built similarly to [shiny forms repo](https://github.com/daattali/shinyforms).  To support the white shark program, additional features were tailored to the program's research needs and implemented within the app, including:

* standardization & cross-referencing of photoID labels for consistent formating and avoid duplicates/errors;
* set of mandatory fields necessary for entering data;
* dynamic leaflet map for click-friendly estimation of sighting's GPS location;
* auto-populating tables for quick visual checks of data entry;
* data review stage that is independent of data entry & auto-populates a review table based on the survey's date, location, and the data previously staged with that metadata.  

## Survey Info
The app starts by collecting data on the survey's location, date, crew, vessel, effort, and any notes or observations from that day. Since this info is central to the organizing observations and autopopulates photoID fields for sightings, data entry should focus on entering surveys individually.  Any data pertaining to the entire survey should be entered in this panel

In the below example, I am entering data for a SEFI survey on 2018 October 21, noted that day's Cafe Cam deployment, and am ready to click the button for fin entry.  NOTE: the red stars indicating mandatory fields of location & date that must be populated to create a photoID.  

![*Survey info entry is beginning for a Farallons survey on 2018 October 21.*](photo_readme/photo_surveyInfo.png)

## Fin Photo Entry
Individual fin photos and shark sighting data are entered in the "Fin Photo Entry" panel, which begins rather blank until adequate data is entered to submit an observation.  For observations to be admitted to the portal, the user must supply a photo, location/date/sighting number for a unique photoID, and a sex/size estimation (n.b.: unknown can be entered in these fields).  

Note that no buttons ("mas fins" or "ready to submit") appear until the fin photo and essential photoID data are supplied.  Also note the red astericks indicating a all mandatory fields for observations. The list of mandatory fields can be managed within the function library.  

![*A blank entry page is displayed until a photo is uploaded and a unique photoID is created from the location, date, sighting number fields.](photo_readme/photo_finEntry_blank.png)

When enough data is supplied to create a unique photoID, the uploaded photo is rendered on screen and additional fields become availabe for entry.  The user can now append additional data including: existing or newly deployed tags, notes about the observation or possible match, & lat/lon estimated from a clickable map.  For quick visual checks, the table at the bottom of the page auto-populates with the fields as they appear in database entries.  Note the buttons for storing and staging this data for submission are now available.  

![*The portal renders an uploaded photo & red text describing photoID creation, indicating enough data has been supplied to create a unique photoID & the remaining data entry can be completed.*](photo_readme/photo_finEntry_fin.png)

The remaining data can be entered once a photo & unique photoID are created.  In the left column, users can provide notes, any tags detected or observed on the animal, and if any new tags were deployed on the animal.  In the case of new deployments, additional data is requested for the side deployed on, tagID number, notes about the tag's programming/package set up, and if a biopsy was taken and stored in a vial.  In the center, the leaflet map estimates lat/lon based on the user's click where the shark was sighted.  At the bottom is a quickly referenced table to visually check how the data will appear w/in the database.

## Data Submission
The final panel allows the user to ensure data accuracy and completeness before submitting the observations to the database. The user can select all staged files associated with a survey date/location, which are then downloaded & used to populate the table for error checking.  The table initially populates with sightings from the same date/location being entered previously (but user can easily click to submit observations from another day).  

Note importantly no submission button appears until the user checks "I HAVE VERIFIED THE DATA". 

![*Visual checks should confirm accurate data for all fields and all sightings.  Dropdown menu above allows user to select, review, and submit data that has already been staged from other surveys.*](photo_readme/photo_dbSubmit.png)

When the user manually clicks "I HAVE VERIFIED THE DATA", the submission button appears and will allow the user to migrate data from the staging area and the database.  

This stage will require additional development to support the full needs of database integration.  In particular, new development should priortize an editing feature for the table, either through directly editable cells or checkboxes for entry deletion (and then repeat entry).  Furthermore, database integration must be supported for migrating data from staged areas into the formal database.  Finally, this panel can also be used to support matching processes.  

### Software Needs and Dependencies
The app was developed iteratively to maintain full functionality (at one stage) and develop new features (in the next version).  App5.R and App6.R are nearly interchangeable.  App6 began development of update messages & naming conflicts, but is otherwise functionally equivalent to app5.R

The app critically depends both on two resources.  First, a function library is stored inside the top-level directory for support in the shiny processing, directory pathways and database management, and metadata standards (e.g., site codes/locs, users, mandatory fields, etc.)  

Second, it relies on a cloud-based database with a standardized folder structure that includes /FinIDs_parent (i.e., the fin library of all fin photos), /FinIDs_refs (i.e., the reference library of all individuals), and /FinIDs_staging (i.e., a sandbox for prepping data and photos prior to an error check & official submission to database).  A zip file of this file structure as it was hosted on dropbox is included in the repo for future migration to other systems.  Pathways to these folders are managed at the top of the function library.  Access requires a authorized token, which can be generated by these instructions

This software is not fully operational, and needs final bug sleuthing to make operation.  Foremost, Okta is debilitating dropbox integration, but was not developed further in Spring 2019 bc expected AWS migration.  As such, final linkages between entered data & database submission (including, migrating/moving staged files, appending/updating rows) were unable to be completed.  Finally, error & update messages should be implemented to update users as to the app's processing.  

### RDS Token help
As of April 2019, the app depends on valid authorization tokens to access the dropbox.  These are generated by the [rdrop2 pkg](https://github.com/karthik/rdrop2) by running the cmd *drop_auth* (or drop_autho(new_user = T)), followed by *saveRDS(token, file = "droptoken.rds")* to download the token and store alongside the app.  See additional help on authorization in the package's readme: https://github.com/karthik/rdrop2
